# You will develop an API containing the CRUD for USERS. 
 A User should be able to: 
1. Update their account data; 
2. Delete their account; 
3. Get their account data; 
Also, we want an Admin User, this admin will be able to: 
1. Do all the previous actions on its own account; 
2. LIST all users and their account data; 
3. DELETE any user; 
The user model should contain the following information: 
Name 
Email 
Password 
Role (in case of Admin) 
2. Create Simple UI and integrate above all APIs in meaning full way to demonstrate utility. example: To integrate create user API, 
you have to take input from user like name, email, password, role and then user clicks submit button on whichcreateuser api should be called. 
Lastly, itâ€™s important that everything is tested.
